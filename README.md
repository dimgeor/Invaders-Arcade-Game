<h1 align="center">Invaders Arcade Game</h1>
<p>
</p>

> An Invaders arcade game for the tiva-c launchpad and the mk-II boosterpack based on my custom RTOS.
> The specific RTOS was made as part of my final project for the Real Time Bluetooth Networks EDX course. 
> The project was made on Keil uVision5.

> The BSP (Board Support Package) files were provided by the instructors.

> Because my MK-II boosterpack came faulty without the temperature sensor I had to modify the BSP files. The originals are included.
